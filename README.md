# Landing rockets like a boss
FALL is a Fully Autonomous Launch and Landing module for KOS mod.

This personal project has been refined and documented for educational and practical purposes. If you enjoy fun experiences with less explosions look no further, the magic is about to happen.

#### Disclaimer

The very nature of this module makes testing a very time consuming task with nearly countless possibilities and test cases.
